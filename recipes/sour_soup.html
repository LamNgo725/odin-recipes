    <h3>
        One of many traditional Vietnameses soups that will have your mouth watering day and 
        night. Sour flavor will stick with you all your life.
    </h3>
    <p> 
        <em>Canh chua</em>, also known as Vietnameses sweet & sour soup, comes from the <em>Mekong 
        Delta</em> in southern Vietnam. It includes a <b>tamarind broth</b> filled with fish 
        (typically catfish) from the delta, <b>pineapple</b>, <b>tomatoes</b>, <b>elephant ear stalks</b>, 
        and <b>bean sprouts</b>. And it is usually served with a side of white rice and 
        <em>Ca Kho To</em>. Like with many Vietnameses dishes, there are a ton of different 
        interpretations, and every family has their own version(of course, mine is the best).
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>

        <li> 4 sprigs of culantro, <i>chopped</i> </li>
        <li> Small bundle of rice paddy herbs <em>(ngo om)</em>, <i>chopped</i></li>
        <li> 1 elephant ear stem <em>(taro stem)</em>, <i>peeled & diagonally chopped</i>/li>
        <li> 2 medium tomatoes, <i>cut into quarter wedges</i></li>
        <li> 2 stalks of celery, <i>diagonally chopped</i></li>
        <li> 1 cup of diced pineapples</li>

        <li> 4 green onions, <i>chopped</i></li>

    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>* Note</b>: Some of the specialty herbs may be hard to find if you do not have a 
        local Asian market in your area. If so, the recipe can still be made substituting 
        those herbs with cilantro.

    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> 
            Season the catfish steaks on both sides with salt, pepper, and chicken base 
            powder and set aside.
        </li>
        <li> 
            In a medium pot over medium-high heat, add the vegetable oil then add the 
            minced garlic and fry until it is a light golden-brown. Set aside in a 
            small bowl to use to garnish the broth at the end.
        </li>
        <li> 
            Add <b>8 cups of water</b> to the pot along with the tamarind soup base, sugar, 
            lemon juice, Tabasco Sauce, and fish sauce. Bring to a boil and cook 
            the catfish for about <b>6 to 8 minutes</b> until the catfish is tender. Remove 
            the catfish and set aside to be added back in later.
        </li>
        <li> 
            Add the tomatoes, pineapples, elephant ear stem, okra, and celery. Cook 
            down to medium tenderness and then add the green onions, rice paddy herbs, 
            culantro, chili pepper, and bean sprouts. Cook for <b>2 minutes</b> and add the 
            catfish back into the soup and continue cooking for an additional <b>2 minutes</b>. 
            Taste the broth and season with fish sauce and tamarind soup base as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with the fried garlic. 
            Serve with a bowl of rice and enjoy!
        </li>
    </ol>
