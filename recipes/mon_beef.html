    <h3>
        This Mongolian beef recipe with green onions has a soy-based sauce for a 
        Chinese-style beef dish. Best served over soft rice noodles or rice.
    </h3>
    <p> 
        Mongolian beef is a dish from <em>Taiwan</em> consisting of sliced beef, typically 
        flank steak, usually made with onions. The beef is commonly paired with 
        scallions or mixed vegetables and is often not spicy. The dish is often 
        served over steamed rice, or in the US, over crispy fried cellophane noodles. 
        It is a staple dish of American Chinese restaurants. Despite its name, the 
        dish has nothing to do with Mongolian cuisine.

        <li> ⅔ cup dark brown sugar </li>
        <li> ½ cup soy sauce </li>
        <li> ½ cup water </li>
        <li> 1 pound beef flank steak, <i>sliced 1/4 inch thick on the diagonal</i> </li>
        <li> ¼ cup cornstarch </li>

    <br/>
    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> 
            Heat 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat. 
            Add garlic and ginger; cook and stir until fragrant, about <b>30 seconds</b>. 
            Stir in brown sugar, soy sauce, and water. Increase heat to medium-high; 
            stir until sauce boils and slightly thickens, about <b>4 minutes</b>. Remove 
            sauce from the heat and set aside.
        </li>
        <li> 
            Place beef into a large bowl; add cornstarch and mix until beef is 
            thoroughly coated. Set aside until most of the cornstarch has been 
            absorbed, about <b>10 minutes</b>.
        </li>
        <li> 
            Heat vegetable oil in a deep skillet to <b>375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</b>.
        </li>
        <li> 
            Shake excess cornstarch from beef slices and drop into hot oil, a few 
            at a time, stirring briefly and frying until edges become crisp, about 
            <b>2 minutes</b>. Remove beef with a large slotted spoon; drain on paper towels.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove excess oil from the skillet, then heat the skillet over medium 
            heat; add beef slices and stir in prepared sauce. Add green onions and 
            bring to a boil; cook until the onions have just softened and are bright 
            green, about <b>1 to 2 minutes</b>.
        </li>
    </ol>
