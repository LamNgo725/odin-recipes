    <h3>
        Chicken <em>phở</em> is pretty healthy if you use minimally processed ingredients, lots of 
        healthy aromatics, spices, herbs, and veggies. You can make it even healthier 
        by choosing leaner meats and avoiding processed dipping sauces, too
    </h3>
    <p> 
        For this one we have bean <b>sprouts</b>, <b>Thai basil</b>, <b>ngo gai</b>, 
        <b>lemon</b>, and <b>fresh chiles</b>. Some say that a clear broth is an important quality 
        in <em>phở</em>, however, my mom says it does not necessarily matter. Flavor is what 
        matters. To me, a slightly cloudy broth with killer taste beats a clear, 
        improperly made soup anyday. Clarity is a nice bonus, but not crucial.
    </p>
    <p>
        What is important is the aromatics and spices that you add to your broth to 
        create that hallmark <em>phở</em> taste. Roasting the ginger and onion intensifies the 
        flavor through the maillard reaction. Star anise pod is the main seasoning 
        that makes <em>phở</em> stand out from other soups, and immediately recognizable as 
        <em>phở</em> which is true of beef <em>phở</em> too.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 medium white or yellow onions roasted </li>
        <li> 20 g fresh ginger roasted </li>
        <li> 2 tbsp coriander seeds </li>
        <li> 1 cinnamon stick approximately 2 inches </li>
        <li> 2 star anise pods </li>
        <li> 1 whole chicken cut in half </li>
        <li> 16 c water </li>
        <li> 2½ tbsp salt </li>
        <li> 2 tbsp sugar </li>
        <li> 2 tsp MSG or 2 tbsp vegetarian seasoning optional </li>
        <li> 16 oz (1 pack) dried phở noodles small noodle thickness </li>
        <li> bean sprouts I prefer blanched </li>
        <li> Thai basil </li>
        <li> lemon sliced into wedges </li>
        <li> <em>ngo gai</em> (culantro) optional </li>
        <li> sliced jalapenos optional </li>
        <li> hoisin sauce </li>
        <li> sriracha </li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> 
            Add the aromatics, spices, and all soup ingredients into 
            a large stock pot and bring to a boil on high heat. Once 
            it hits a boil, lower the heat to maintain a low boil and 
            cook the chicken for <b>25-40 minutes</b> until the chicken is 
            cooked all the way through. You can use a thermometer to 
            make sure the internal temperature reads <b>165°F</b> (or the 
            juices run clear when you cut into the deepest part of 
            the chicken). 
        </li>
        <li> 
            Remove the chicken once done and rinse under cold water 
            for one minute to cool. This will prevent the chicken 
            from getting dark. Once the chicken has cooled, shred 
            the meat into bite-sized pieces.
        </li>
        <li> 
            Cook the rice noodles according to package instructions 
            only just before you are ready to serve it. Cooking the 
            noodles usually take about <b>5 minutes</b> after boiling the 
            water.
        </li>
        <li> 
            To assemble, start with portioning the noodles into a 
            bowl, and then add the soup, shredded chicken, and 
            toppings on top. The proportions of this entire 
            recipe is purely a personalized one. Try to keep the 
            soup to noodle, meat, and toppings ratio <b>2 to 1</b>. You 
            gotta love that soup.
        </li>
    </ol>
